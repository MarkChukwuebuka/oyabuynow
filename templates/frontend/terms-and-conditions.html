          <h4 class="mt-4 fw-semibold">1. Introduction</h4>
          <p>
            Welcome to {{app_config.app_name}} (“we,” “our,” “us”). These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern your access to and
            use of our website, mobile application, and related services (collectively, the “Platform”).
            By accessing or using {{app_config.app_name}}, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the Platform.
          </p>

          <h4 class="mt-4 fw-semibold">2. Nature of the Platform</h4>
          <p>
            {{app_config.app_name}} is an online sales platform that connects vendors who wish to sell products and customers who wish to purchase them.
            We provide a safe and convenient marketplace but do not own or produce most of the products listed on the site.
            Each vendor is responsible for their products, descriptions, and pricing.
          </p>

          <h4 class="mt-4 fw-semibold">3. Account Registration</h4>
          <p>
            To make a purchase or become a vendor, you must create an account on {{app_config.app_name}}.
            You agree to provide accurate, complete, and updated information at all times.
            You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login details and for all activities under your account.
            We reserve the right to suspend or terminate any account that violates these Terms or provides false information.
          </p>

          <h4 class="mt-4 fw-semibold">4. Vendor Responsibilities</h4>
          <ul>

          <h4 class="mt-4 fw-semibold">5. Orders and Payments</h4>
          <p>
            Orders are confirmed only after payment has been successfully processed.
            Payments may be made using approved methods displayed at checkout.
            In the event of stock unavailability, the buyer will be refunded within a reasonable period.
            {{app_config.app_name}} may act as an intermediary to process payments on behalf of vendors but is not responsible for vendor delays or non-performance once the order has been dispatched.
          </p>

          <h4 class="mt-4 fw-semibold">6. Returns, Refunds, and Cancellations</h4>
          <p>

            Refunds will be processed using the original payment method, subject to verification and approval.
            Vendors must honor return and refund requests that meet the approved conditions.
          </p>
