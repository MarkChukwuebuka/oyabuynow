                        <li>If the item meets return conditions, a refund or replacement will be processed.</li>
                        <li>If the item fails inspection (used, damaged by customer, or missing accessories), it will be sent back to you.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Inspection typically takes <strong>2–5 business days</strong> after the returned item is received.</p>
